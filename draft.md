US Presidential Inauguration is the most iconic moment for every US president in history at their start of the presidency. The importance of the inaugural address goes without saying, it follows certain traditions to serve some symbolic purposes, but it also reflects changes and differences that every president is going to make. In 1789, the founding President George Washington solemnly sworn in using as concise as only 56 words. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy's historic speech, “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country”, has deeply rooted in people's mind and echoed through history. The presidential inaugural address is a formality, but it goes way beyond formality. In this project, we use digital tools to explore all the text of the inaugural address in US history.
